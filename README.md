# Overview of project
## Background
This project stemmed from exploring algorithms that are utilized for solving Graph Isomorphism problems. I chose to focus on the Graph-Subgraph Isomorphism problem and wanted to explore how to use graph algorithms to determine the largest common substructures between graphs.

## Motivation
Molecules are ubiquitous. They make up drugs, materials, and many more.

## Background on Algorithm
The VF2 algorithm comes from the paper "An Improved Algorithm for Matching Large Graphs" written by L. P. Cordella, P. Foggia, C. Sansone, and M. Vento. The idea behind
